# 7-segment-2-digit-18-pin

This little project is done to use in a movable airsoft target project that should count the hits. I couldn't find 10 pin 2 digit 7 segment display at the local shop, so I bought this which has 18 pins. Then I wrote this code(est4sSevSeg.ino) and sharing, so that if someone need then don't need to write this all. I also tride to change my segment display to 10 pin, put I had problems on the breadboard most probably because of the wires, then I went like this.

My test board is above. Actually I am not satisfied with the design because its the first pcb design that I did ever, at 25 December 2018 as writen on the board. But it did its job. I made place for two buttons, one for the counting hits which would be changed to a sensor(I was thinking on force sensor), and the other for reset.
